# Ecomm shop

This project represents a template Ecomm shop project for people starting an online store in ASP. It can also be used as a standalone shop without features, as it's base is enought for most users needs.

## Functionality Overview
- ### Users
We support all operations that you could wish to do on users. We have regular users (shoppers) and admins that can control ALL of the app features and data/content.
- ### Shop features
We support all classic shop features like having a product catalog, categories, carts, and order managment. This means that you will have an API that returns you a list of all products (filters possible). After that there is a cart add option which starts the order process. The finishing step will be creation and managment of the order. **All of these steps are manageble thorugh our admins**

- ### Testing
We have provided two test accounts which go with the sample project and DB 
admin - admin@gmail.com - pass: passowrd
user - user@gmail.com - pass: password. So enjoy testing ;)

- ### Documentation
Our api also has a swagger (openapi 3.0) json schema available
